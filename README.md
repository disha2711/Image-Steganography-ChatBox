# Image-Steganography-ChatBox
->This is a research based project which is built using Java that enables a Client connect to a Server for Chatting using Image Steganography.
->The Server generates an OTP on connecting with the Client for authorization.
->Then normal chat will take place but embedding message within images using Encode.
-> To read any message the Client will select a message and opens the Decoder and will be able to decode the image using the OTP provided.
